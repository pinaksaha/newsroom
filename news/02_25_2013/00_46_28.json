  <p>MasterCard has had its hands in the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/7/3005771/mastercard-paypass-wallet">mobile payments space</a> for a long time now, and here at Mobile World Congress 2013, the company is announcing MasterPass, the latest expansion of its mobile payments platform. MasterPass is an extension of MasterCard's existing PayPass program that lets users make payments in person using NFC equipped devices and online with a virtual wallet. MasterPass expands those services with support for payments through QR codes and tags, essentially eliminating the hardware requirements that limited the older system. The system can be used to accept payments regardless of the device in use, whether that be an iOS phone, Android tablet, or something else entirely. Additionally, the platform will enable merchants...</p>

  <p>GM has announced this morning that it will start deploying LTE service from AT&amp;T in its 2014 cars and trucks to deliver drivers "enhanced suite of safety, security, diagnostic and infotainment services." It's a common theme in the auto industry: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/11/3151595/bmw-connecteddrive-2012-update">BMW</a> and Audi have both made announcements around in-vehicle LTE in recent months, but GM's move promises to be the widest-scale deployment of high-speed wireless in cars to date.</p>
<p><q class="right">Fast data for fast cars (and slow ones, too)</q></p>
<p>The companies aren't saying exactly how the connectivity will be used when it shows up in production models from Chevy, Buick, GMC, and Cadillac, but it promises to show off what it calls "conceptual" LTE services here at <a href="http://www.theverge.com/mwc-2013">MWC 2013</a> this week. Also unclear is how the service...</p>

  <p>Our selves have always been mutable, but technological progress throws the question of who we "really are" into sharp relief. John Rainey's "Hyper Activity: Scenes from an Other Reality," <a href="http://www.designboom.com/art/john-rainey-hyper-activity-scenes-from-an-other-reality/" target="_blank">showcased at <i>Designboom</i></a><i>,</i> plays into both anxiety and fetishization of our strange, cyborg future. The installation's figures start as photographs, which are then distorted into eerie virtual models and prototyped with a 3D printer before being cast in porcelain. Referred to as "sculptural hyperbodies and prosthetic others," some evoke human figures stuck in some endless process of transformation, while others are perfectly formed parts of bodies that seem almost more out of place in the surreal landscape.</p>

  <p>Fine Films' <em>Inocente</em> made history tonight as the <a target="_blank" href="http://hasakickstarterprojectwonanoscar.com/">first Kickstarter-funded film to win an Oscar</a>. Taking the prize for Best Documentary Short, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1131717127/inocente-homeless-creative-unstoppable?ref=live"><em>Inocente</em></a> follows the story of a 15-year-old homeless and undocumented girl living in California who refuses to give up on her dream of being an artist. The success goes to show how crowdsourced funding, which is <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/10/3861406/kickstarter-at-ces">transforming the hardware industry</a>, is similarly democratizing filmmaking. Last month, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/3/3832596/kickstarter-passes-100-million-in-pledged-funding-for-film">Kickstarter announced</a> that it helped raise over $100 million for film projects, about 40 percent of which went to fund documentaries.</p>

  <p>Photographer <a href="http://www.matthewrolston.com/" target="_blank">Matthew Rolston</a> is known for his celebrity portraits, but for his latest project he decided to tackle something much different &mdash; ventriloquist dolls. For the book, <a href="http://www.pointedleafpress.com/talking-heads" target="_blank"><i>Talking Heads, The Vent Haven Portraits</i></a>, Rolston travelled to the Vent Haven Museum in Kentucky where he snapped 100 headshots of retired dummies. The results are as creepy as you'd imagine, especially when it comes to some of the older dummies, covered in scratches and scars from a long life of entertaining. If you're curious, you can check out a gallery of some of the dummies <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/2300-504784_162-10014661.html" target="_blank">over at CBS News</a>, before making the splurge on the $75 coffee table book.</p>

  <p>Barnes &amp; Noble looks to be scaling back its Nook e-reader and tablet hardware efforts, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/25/business/media/barnes-noble-weighs-its-nook-losses.html?smid=tw-NYTimesAd&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">according to a <em>New York Times </em>report</a><em>.</em> An unnamed source familiar with the company&rsquo;s corporate strategy says that while "they are not completely getting out of the hardware business," executives are realizing that they need to shift focus from low-margin hardware to licensing its "crown jewel" content to other platforms. The news follows a string of lackluster quarters for the Nook division, culminating in news that it would post an <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/13/3987046/barnes-noble-warns-of-bigger-losses-for-nook-division">even bigger loss than it forecasted in January</a>, which in turn was bigger than the $262 million hit the division took in 2012.</p>
