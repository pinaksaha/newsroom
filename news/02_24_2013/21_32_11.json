  <p>Photographer <a href="http://www.matthewrolston.com/" target="_blank">Matthew Rolston</a> is known for his celebrity portraits, but for his latest project he decided to tackle something much different &mdash; ventriloquist dolls. For the book, <a href="http://www.pointedleafpress.com/talking-heads" target="_blank"><i>Talking Heads, The Vent Haven Portraits</i></a>, Rolston travelled to the Vent Haven Museum in Kentucky where he snapped 100 headshots of retired dummies. The results are as creepy as you'd imagine, especially when it comes to some of the older dummies, covered in scratches and scars from a long life of entertaining. If you're curious, you can check out a gallery of some of the dummies <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/2300-504784_162-10014661.html" target="_blank">over at CBS News</a>, before making the splurge on the $75 coffee table book.</p>

  <p>Barnes &amp; Noble looks to be scaling back its Nook e-reader and tablet hardware efforts, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/25/business/media/barnes-noble-weighs-its-nook-losses.html?smid=tw-NYTimesAd&amp;_r=0">according to a <em>New York Times </em>report</a><em>.</em> An unnamed source familiar with the company&rsquo;s corporate strategy says that while "they are not completely getting out of the hardware business," executives are realizing that they need to shift focus from low-margin hardware to licensing its "crown jewel" content to other platforms. The news follows a string of lackluster quarters for the Nook division, culminating in news that it would post an <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/13/3987046/barnes-noble-warns-of-bigger-losses-for-nook-division">even bigger loss than it forecasted in January</a>, which in turn was bigger than the $262 million hit the division took in 2012.</p>
<p>As <i>The Times</i> points out, a shift in strategy away from hardware would be a radical re-thinking...</p>

  <p>Back in January 2012, the <a href="http://www.nih.gov/about/director/01202012_h5n1_statement.htm" target="_blank">US government announced</a> it was joining with scientists around the world and temporarily suspending research on the deadly pathogen H5N1, also known as avian flu or "bird flu," after an independent review panel found that publishing research results could potentially allow bioterrorists or other attackers to recreate and transmit a more contagious version of the virus on their own. But since <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/23/3909458/avian-flu-research-resumes" target="_blank">international research resumed in January</a>, the US government is looking to get back into studying the virus as well, including potentially funding the development of new, more infectious strains capable of being spread by coughing.</p>

  <p>Earlier this week, Nvidia announced a major milestone in its mobile development history: its first chip to combine both the applications processor and LTE modem on the same silicon. The <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/19/4004116/nvidia-tegra-4i-lte-and-quad-core-together-at-last">Tegra 4i</a>, as it is called, is the green team's counter to Qualcomm's dominance in the mobile space &mdash; by having the power efficiency of integrated LTE, Nvidia now <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/29/2832546/nvidia-tegra-3-lte-problem-mwc-2012-report">stands a chance</a> to figure in the flagship 4G devices gracing advanced markets like the US. But the company's ambitions, as is usually the case, go much further than that. Nvidia wants to build "mainstream superphones," devices with today's highest specs, priced at tomorrow's mid-range prices.</p>
